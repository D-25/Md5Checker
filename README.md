# openChecker | MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 checker tool.
Check MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 with an easy tool developed with QT.
Previously was named MD5Checker, so inside the code may be some old references.

### Almost completed!
The first version is almost ready to be released... we're working hard to it! We haven't implemented all things inside the To Do List. It will happen soon, just stay tuned a little more.
It will be released for Windows, Linux and Mac.

#### To Do List

- [x] Settings!
- [x] Implement SHA checking.
- [ ] Better Windows integration.
- [ ] Multiple file checking.
- [x] Drag & Drop support.
- [x] Graphics and Icon.

### Compilation
You can compile this project easily: clone this project and run `qmake Md5Checker.pro` and then `make` it. If you need to build the Portable Edition, you first need to compile QT Static.

### Known Bugs
We must fix these in order to publish first release.
- [ ] On Mac the user interface isn't perfect.
